# Handling Null Values in JavaScript Functions

This example showcases a common error in JavaScript: not explicitly handling null values passed as function arguments.  The provided code includes a solution to safely handle such cases and prevent errors.

## Problem

When a JavaScript function receives a null value as an argument, it may lead to unexpected results or runtime errors if not appropriately handled.  This is especially true when performing arithmetic or string operations.

## Solution

The provided solution includes a check for null values at the beginning of the function.  If either argument 'a' or 'b' is null, the function returns null.  Otherwise, it performs the intended addition operation.

This approach ensures that the function operates correctly regardless of whether null values are passed as arguments, avoiding potential errors and unexpected behavior.
